\begin{abstract}
Modeling and forecasting energy consumption is of high relevance to the grid operator and energy providers. We analyze total energy consumption in Switzerland at a weekly, daily and quarter-hourly level with the aim to create accurate forecasts. Despite the challenging, irregular nature of the data, we are able to obtain reasonable long-term forecasts for coarse time levels. However, more work needs to be done to obtain good forecasts at a smaller temporal resolution.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The energy grid is a highly complex network that has to be tightly controlled by the so-called grid operator in order to assure its well-functioning. In particular, energy consumption has to be at equilibrium with production at all times to avoid blackouts with possibly fatal consequences. It is therefore of great interest to accurately model and forecast the energy consumption, such that the energy made available to the grid can be adjusted accordingly. Moreover, long-term forecasting is of interest to adjust the energy strategy: How much power plants will be needed in the future and should be built? 
\par
Within the scope of this work, we therefore aim to generate accurate forecasts for the total energy consumption of the Swiss energy grid. To this effect, we analyze the quarter-hourly grid data between 2009 and 2019 available from the Swiss grid operator, Swissgrid [CITATION!!!]. We start with weekly integrated data before we move on to daily integrated data before tackling the quarter-hourly energy consumption data, thus increasing the model complexity step by step. We thereby hope to create more and more accurate models for the data that are able to capture both long- and short term trends in order to finally create accurate forecasts.
\par
In order to compare forecast accuracy between the models, we construct our models on the data up to and including 2017. We then assess the accuracy of the forecasts on the data of the year 2018 for model comparison. 
\par
It seems intuitive that energy consumption at least in part negatively relates to temperature, since high temperatures require less energy consumption for electrical heating. We therefore use the average temperature series of five locations spread throughout Switzerland made available by Agroscope as regressors for some of our modelsÂ [Citation!!!]. The data is originally 10 minutely, a quarter-hourly time series is obtained through linear interpolation.  

\section{Data Exploration}

	\label{SeriesPlot}
\end{figure*}
We start off our analysis with an exploratory data analysis. The full time series for energy consumption together with representative weeks and days are shown in \ref{SeriesPlot}. From the plots, it becomes apparent that there are multiple levels of seasonality present in the data. First of all, we see a roughly sinusoidal yearly variation, with higher values during winter months than summer. Secondly, we see a weekly repetitive pattern, with lower energy consumption during the week-end as compared to the work days. Finally, we see a highly irregular daily pattern with the highest energy consumption right before lunchtime.
\par
Moreover, on the plot of the full time series we observe a sharp drop in energy consumption around Christmas and New Year. The same applies for other public holidays such as the first of August or  easter. Note that the public holidays vary from canton to canton, but the following ones are common to most cantons: January first and second, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Ascension, Pentecost Monday, the first of August (the Swiss national day), and finally the 25. and 26 of December. 
\par


\section{Weekly Integrated Data}
We begin by considering weekly integrated data. A plot of the resulting time series can be seen in Figure \ref{weekly}. The integrated data only exhibits a yearly seasonality, whereas the daily and weekly seasonal patterns are removed through the integration. There are multiple approaches that can be considered in order to allow for that seasonality, three of which are outlined in the following sections. Moreover, from the plot in Figure \ref{weekly} it becomes apparent that the energy consumption systematically drops in the weeks around New Year. In order to take this into account, we label weeks that end between December 25th and January 8th as holiday weeks and treat them specially. 

\begin{figure*}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figs/weeklyInt+Temperature.pdf}
	\caption{Top: Weekly consumption. Bottom: Average weekly temperature (negative scale).}
	\label{weekly}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Modeling Seasonality with Sine and Cosine}
A simple, intuitive approach is to regress out a sinusoidal pattern while fitting an ARIMA($p$, $d$, $q$) model to the data. This was done by regressing against sine and cosine terms with periodicity $T=365.25 / 7 \simeq 52$, corresponding to a yearly oscillation with unknown phase. Moreover, to capture harmonics, $T / 2$ up to $T / 5$ were also added to the fit. Finally, an indicator variable for the holiday season was added to capture the special behavior during that period. This first model will be referred to as model W1.
\par
The ACF and PACF of the regression residuals can be seen on the left side of Figure \ref{weekly_mod1}. The ACF of the residuals still shows some periodic structure, which is not completely removed through differencing. This seasonal structure is not present in the PACF. Looking at the ACF and PACF plots, it is not obvious what the optimal ARIMA parameters are, but $p=6$, $d=1$ and $q=4$ seem to be a reasonable choice. 
\par
Fitting an ARIMA(6,1,4) model with the aforementioned regressors yields an AIC of 2586.7. The model diagnostics can be seen on the right side of Figure \ref{weekly_mod1}. A visual inspection of the standardized residuals and ACF suggests that no apparent seasonal patterns remain after model fitting. Moreover, the p-values of the Ljung-Box indicate that the residuals do not exhibit serial correlation. The cumulative periodogram suggests that the residuals are white noise. However, the Q-Q plot of the residuals exhibits heavy tails, suggesting that the residuals do not follow a normal distribution.

	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figs/Fig3.pdf}
	\caption{Left: ACF and PACF of weekly data after adding sine and cosine regressors. Right: Diagnostic plots for ARIMA model with sine and cosine regressors.}
	\label{weekly_mod1}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Modeling Seasonality with Temperature}
Considering Figure \ref{weekly}, we can see that the weekly energy consumption follows closely the negative average temperature. We therefore use the weekly average temperature in addition to the holiday indicator as a regressor when fitting a second ARIMA model. This model will be referred to as model W2.
\par
Figure \ref{weekly_mod2} shows on the left side the ACF and the PACF of the residuals after the regression. The ACF of the residuals indicates that there is some residual periodicity, manifested by oscillations with period 52 (corresponding to one year) in the plot. The PACF however seems well-behaved. These plots suggest an ARMA(1,4) model, where the results have to be treated with care due to the residual oscillations. Differencing lead to a slightly better behaved ACF, although the periodicity remains. However the PACF that was before well-behaved now seems probematic, with many significant values at a large lag. These plots suggest an ARIMA(4, 1, 1) model.
\par
We fit both the ARMA(1,4) and the ARIMA(4,1,1) model and compare them in terms of AIC. With an AIC of 2555.8, the model without differencing outperforms the integrated model with an AIC of 2562.5. The diagnostic plots for the ARMA model can be found on the right side of Figure \ref{weekly_mod2} and do not suggest any problems with the model. In particular, compared to the model W1, the residual distribution seems to be more close to a normal. Also note that the AIC increased by around 30.

	\caption{Left: ACF and PACF of weekly data after adding temperature regressor. Right: Diagnostic plots for ARIMA model with temperature regressor.}
	\label{weekly_mod2}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Modeling Yearly Seasonality with SARIMA}
We can also model the seasonality using a seasonal ARIMA model with a 52 week seasonality. Visual inspection of the ACF and PACF plots shown in Figure \ref{Fig5} suggest taking $D=1$. After seasonal differencing, the ACF and PACF suggest taking a SMA(2) model. The non-seasonal component is less clear and we settle on an ARMA(1,2) model. The resulting model is $SARIMA(1,0,2)\times(0,1,2)_{52}$. 
\par
The resulting diagnostic plots look good with slight non-gaussianity in the qq-plot. The AIC is 2312.1, which is substantially better than the other models examined before.

	\caption{Left: ACF and PACF of weekly data, as well as with lag 52 differencing. Right: Diagnostic plots for SARIMA model with yearly seasonality. }
	\label{weekly_mod2}
\end{figure*}


\section{Daily Integrated Data}
Having obtained reasonable models for weekly integrated data, we refine the temporal step to daily integrated data. This coarser version reveals a second level of seasonality, the variation in energy consumption throughout the week. To ease computation we remove leap days from our analysis. Moreover, in order to handle work-free days appropriately, we create a categorical variable for Saturdays and a categorical variable for Sundays and the most widespread public holidays. 

\subsection{Modeling Seasonality with Sine and Cosine}
The first approach to modeling seasonality we took was to fit an ARIMA model with sine and cosine regressors with a weekly and a yearly period in addition to the aforementioned regressors for work-free days. After fitting the model, there still was considerable yearly and weekly structure present in the residuals (data not shown), indicating that another approach for modeling the multiple seasonality has to be taken. In addition, adding temperature as regressor did not improve the model. 

\subsection{Modeling Weekly Seasonality with SARIMA}
We therefore in a second approach model the weekly seasonality using a SARIMA model with period $T=7$ and remove the yearly structure by using sine and cosine regressors. Moreover, we add the Saturday and Sunday/holiday indicator variables as regressors. 
\par
A good fit was obtained using a $SARIMA(3, 0, 1)\times(2, 1, 2)_{7}$ model. The cumulative periodogram and Ljung-Box test shown in Figure \ref{daily_sarima} suggest that the residuals seem independent and are white noise. However, they follow a more heavy-tailed distribution than the normal distribution, as shown by the QQ plot. Moreover, looking at the ACF, we see that there is still some remaining structure within the residuals, among which notably a remaining yearly periodicity. Note that again, incorporating temperature as a regressor did not increase the quality of the fit.

\par
The heavy-tailed normal distribution could be indicative of a GARCH structure within the data. Additionally, considering the residuals in Figure \ref{daily_sarima} it seems that the volatility increases towards the end of the time series. However, fitting a GARCH model did not yield satisfactory results. The resulting residuals were highly correlated and clearly not white noise according to the cumulative periodograms (data not shown).

	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figs/Fig6.pdf}
	\caption{Diagnostic plots for SARIMA model for daily consumption with weekly seasonality.}
	\label{daily_sarima}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Removing Non-Work Days from Data}
In an attempt to further better our model, we subsequently removed all non-work days (i.e. Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) from our data by setting them to \texttt{NA}. We argue that an appropriate model only for work days are still highly relevant, since it models more than 2/3 of the year and since consumption on work days is considerably higher than on free days. 
\par
We found that $SARIMA(2, 1, 2) \times (0, 1, 1)_7$ yields a good fit. The corresponding diagnostics are shown in Figure \ref{daily_nowe}. The diagnostic plots of the fit are similar to the ones with the work-days, with in particular a yearly component remaining. We see a slight improvement in the ACF plot of the residuals, which contains less structure than before. Moreover, the residuals seem to follow a normal distribution more closely than before, although the tails remain slightly heavy.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figs/Fig7.pdf}
	\caption{Diagnostic plots for daily model, where work-free days were set to NA. The ACF plots were generated using the option \texttt{na.pass} to handle the missing values.}
	\label{daily_nowe}
\end{figure*}


\section{15min Data}
We now look at the data in the 15 minute timeframe, as present in the original data provided by SWISSGRID. When we look at the time series itself and the ACF plot in figure \ref{fig8}, we can see that there are at least 3 seasonalities. They are daily (lag 96), weekly (lag 672) and yearly (lag 35040). This also aligns with our intuition: In addition to the weekly patterns (weekend) and yearly patterns (summer-winter), we expect to have a daily pattern (day-night).
\par
Normal SARIMA models donât support multiple seasonalities. We therefore resort to another model called TBATS (\textbf{T}rigonometric, \textbf{B}ox-Cox transform, \textbf{A}RMA errors, \textbf{T}rend and \textbf{S}easonal components) proposed by De Livera, Alysha M., Rob J. Hyndman and Ralph D. Snyder \cite{TBATS_paper}. The TBATS model uses a Fourier series to model each seasonality. Box-Cox transformations are also incorporated and the residuals are modeled using an ARMA model.
\par
The result, shown in Figure \ref{fig8} is not convincing however. The residuals are clearly neither Gaussian nor white noise. More work would have to be done to obtain a good result here. For example, one could use the predictions from our previous models for higher time-frames as covariates for a model. After obtaining the prediction for the day, we could limit ourself to just modeling the daily evolution. However we would have to take into account the fact that weekends have a different pattern than weekdays. Since the variance of the residuals seems constant, a GARCH model is unlikely to improve on the fit.

\end{figure*}


\section{Forecasting}
We perform the forecasting with the R-function `forecast` in the forecast package. The confidence bands therefore don't take into account parameter and model uncertainty. Also, we assumed the temperature regressor to be deterministic, which is obviously not the case in reality. This uncertainty should also be incorporated into the confidence bands, yielding an underestimation of the confidence region size. To create more accurate confidence bands, we suggest using bootstrapping. The forecasts are plotted in Figure \ref{forecasts}, where we show the actual evolution in red.
\subsection{Weekly}
We forecast 52 weeks (1 year) after the end of our traning set. The start is therfore January 1st 2018. 
Not surprisingly, the predictions made with Fourier regressors are very smooth. When we look at the forecasts with the temperature regressor, we see that their performance is inferior to the one with Fourier regressors. Notably, the confidence bands are wider. Also, the model with zero mean is not a very good predictor. 
The forecast of the SARIMA model is very close to the actual value, also the model with Fourier regressors performs well.
\subsection{Daily}
We forecast for 365 days (1 year) after the end of our traning set. The start is therefore January 1st 2018. 
This time, we removed weekend and holiday datapoints from the actual time series for the forecast and linearly interpolated them.
We see that the performance is acceptable, but not nearly as good as the one seen on the weekly timeframe.
The yearly evolution is captured, but lower grain evolution (intraweekly) is not captured well by our model.
\subsection{15min}
We forecast using the TBATS model for 1 month. The result is close to the actual value, but the obtained confidence bands are very wide. The daily pattern is captured quite well, but the amplitude seems to be too small for the regular weekdays.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we were able to generate accurate models on the coarse weekly level containing only one - the yearly - seasonality. This model can be used to generate accurate forecasts for the long-term future. 
\par
However, when refining the temporal step to daily consumption, modeling becomes significantly more difficult. A particular challenge is to accurately model the energy consumption during the days of the week which are work-free, since the consumption pattern is considerably different from work days. Not surprisingly, we obtain the best model for daily data by simply disregarding work-free days. This reduced model is still valuable to network operators as it accurately models the majority of days of the year.
\par
The task becomes even more difficult when considering quarter-hourly data. The energy consumption throughout the day follows a particular pattern, which is again very different on work- and work free days. While the model we provide creates reasonable forecasts, the confidence intervals are very large. More work has thus to be done in order to create a better model for intra-day consumption data.
\par
Further work could be done by incorporating multi-level seasonality in a state space model. Moreover, additional regressors to temperature may be of use in order to make the model more accurate. A more nested approach, where more refined models are fitted only on the residuals of the coarser models could also be of interest. Finally, using bootstrapping for the forecast confidence intervals could be used to give more accurate prediction intervals.
